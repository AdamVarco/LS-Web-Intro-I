# Homework 1


## Instructions

You will need to have Google Chrome (or maybe Mozilla Firefox but we'd recommend Chrome) dowloaded as well as an editor for your code.  We recommend that you download SublimeText3 or Atom.

For this assignment you will use HTML and CSS to replicate the images found in three folders inside of this project.  Each folder should have its own HTML file and CSS file.  You can then open each HTML file in Google Chrome to view the work that you have done.  As you make changes simply refresh the browser to see your updated code.  Be sure to save your code before you refresh otherwise you will not see any changes.
